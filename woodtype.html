<h1>Overview</h1>
Your choice of wood is slightly more important if you use an ‘old school’ style wood burning smoker.

Most pitmasters these days use charcoal, electric or gas as their primary heat source and simply add wood chunks or chips for the flavor. <br>

    <h3 class="center">Main points</h3>
    -If the wood has been left to dry out for around 6 months, it is just right for using on your barbecue. This is because there is still enough moisture in the wood to create smoke, without being too sappy.<br>
    -Store bought woods are likely kiln dried, which means they will burn hot and fast. This may prove challenging when trying to control the temperature and length of your cook.<br>
    -Another advantage of using wood with some moisture remaining in it is that the wood will burn slower at a lower heat. Clearly, this is good news if you aim to cook ‘low and slow’.<br>

    <h1>The Types</h1>
    <p class="left">Even though most evidence says that the belief different types of wood produce different flavors is mostly barbecue myth, there are some general rules of thumb that seem to hold true.</p>

    <p class="leftborder left">Oak – Burns slow and even, has a mild flavor, and is generally a good wood for smoking.<br>
    Hickory – Also good for smoking, with a stronger flavor than oak.<br>
    Pecan – With a stronger, smoky and sweet flavor, this wood is better for shorter smokes. If used for longer smokes, the flavor can become overpowering.<br>
    Mesquite – Strong flavored wood, which burns hot and fast, and produces a lot of smoke. Best used for grilling, or to burn down as coals.<br>
    Fruit woods – Mild in flavor, and can be used green.<br></p>
