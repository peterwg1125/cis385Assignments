        <p class="left">Smoked meat is the result of the method of preparing meat and seafood that originated all the way back in the
            Paleolithic Era. This method provides flavor to the meat as well as change the appearance through the Maillard reaction
            which results in the iconic smoke ring present in smoked meats. Generally, there is two types of smoking, cold and hot
            with cold smoking occurring below 90 °F and hot smoking occurring above 160 °F. We will mainly focus on hot smoking
            with information on what temperature meat should be cooked to as well as the different types of wood available and
            popular types of smokers on the market. Links that are provided on the left will have additional information on each of these topics.
